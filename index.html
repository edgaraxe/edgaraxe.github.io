				<h2>BIM Designer</h2>

				<h2>UX Designer</h2>
				<p>UX design is something that I have worked with closely for the past 5 years. I have freelanced and I am still working on exiting UX projects daily. I have also been employed by multiple companies to solve their complex user experience design needs. I am especially skilled at E-commerce; One long-term project I worked on was for TietoEvry where I helped them achieve the idea of a <a href="https://shop.evry.com/">one-stop-shop</a>.</p>
				<p>I am proud of my abilities to research user experience solutions, especially a case study I completed named <a href="https://muep.mau.se/handle/2043/32273">Seichi Junrei</a>. The Seichi Junrei project showcases long-term research into the "Otaku" sub-culture and applies an intuitive standard to digitally-aided tourism in Japan.</p>
				<p>I have strong planning and prototyping skills. I have applied my abilities to create software apps and websites with powerful positive impacts on businesses and communities; from increasing the traffic of 10,000 member digital communities by 150% to enterprise UX solutions that generate millions of Swedish kronor daily. My design process consists of six strategic points.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Understanding.</li>
					<li>Research.</li>
					<li>Analyze.</li>
					<li>Design.</li>
					<li>Launch.</li>
					<li>Analyze again.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I make sure that my clients are with me through the whole journey of the design cycle; I keep them involved and informed in every strategic point of the plan to ensure success. I am proficient with most Adobe UX design products, Balsamiq, Figma, Sketch, Basecamp, and lots more.</p>
